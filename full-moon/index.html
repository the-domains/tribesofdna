<p>I Act </p><p> "The wind of God, His breath divine, sweeps through the garden....... Low lie the flowers. Bending, the trees are devastated by the wind. Destruction of all beauty is followed by the rain. The sky is black. Ruin is seen. Then death......... Later another garden! But the time seems far away. Call for a gardener. The gardener, the soul, responds. Call for the rain, the wind, the scorching sun. Call for the gardener. Then let the work go on. Ever destruction goes before the rule of beauty. Ruin precedes the real. The garden and the gardener must awake! The work proceeds." </p><p> ~.~ </p><p> I Love </p><p> "He stores the nuggets of the knowledge as a squirrel stores its nuts. The storehouse now is adequately full....... Suddenly a spade descends, for the thinker tends the garden of his thought, and thus destroys the passages of mind. Ruin arrives, destroying fast the storehouse of the mind, the safe security, the darkness and the warmth of a satisfied enquiry. All is removed. The light of summer enters in and the darkened crannies of the mind see light....... Naught is left but light, and that cannot be used. The eyes are blinded and the one eye seeth not as yet....... Slowly the eye of wisdom must be opened. Slowly the love of that which is true, the beautiful and good must enter the dark passages of worldly thought. Slowly the torch of light, the fire of right must burn the garnered treasures of the past, yet show their basic usefulness...... The seven ways of light must wean away the attention of the Scholar from all that has been found and stored and used. This he repulses and finds his way into the Hall of Wisdom which is built upon a hill, and not deep under ground. Only the opened eye can find the way." </p><p> ~.~ </p><p> I Think </p><p> "Loud voices, and a movement from outside the darkened chamber where the Weaver sits; they grow in volume and in power. A window breaks and, though the Weaver cries aloud, blinded by the sudden light, the sun shines in upon his woven carpet. Its ugliness is thus revealed.... A voice proclaims: 'Look from out thy window, Weaver, and see the pattern in the skies, the model of the plan, the colour and the beauty of the whole. Destroy the carpet which you have for ages wrought. It does not meet your need........ Then weave again, Weaver. Weave in the light of day. Weave, as you see the plan.'" </p><p> ~.~ </p><p> I Battle "But crashing came a note of music, a chord of sound which drove the Mixer of sweet sounds to quiet. His sounds died out within the Sound and only the great chord of God was heard. A flood of light poured in. His colours faded out. Around him naught but darkness could be seen, yet in the distance loomed the light of God. He stood between his nether darkness and the blinding light. His world in ruins lay around. His friends were gone. Instead of harmony, there was dissonance. Instead of beauty, there was found the darkness of the grave........ The voice then chanted forth these words: 'Create again, my child, and build and paint and blend the tones of beauty, but this time for the world and not thyself.' The Mixer started then his work anew and worked again." </p><p> ~.~ </p><p> I Plan </p><p> "Through the opening on the summit of the pyramid, dropped from the blue of heaven, a key came down. It landed at the feet of the discouraged worker. The key was of pure gold; the shaft of light; upon the key a label, and writ in blue, these words: 'Destroy that which thou has built and build anew. But only build when thou has climbed the upward way, traversed the gallery of tribulation and entered into light within the chamber of the king. Build from the heights, and thus show forth the value of the depths.' The Worker then destroyed the objects of his previous toil, sparing only three treasures which he knew were good, and upon which the light could shine. He struggled towards the chamber of the king. And still he struggles." </p><p> ~.~ </p><p> I Feel </p><p> "Another pilgrim in the dark came up, and groping, found the Follower. 'Lead me and others to the Light,' he cried. The Follower found no words, no indicated Leader, no formulas of truth, no forms or ceremonies. He found himself a leader, and drew others to the light - the light that shone on every hand. He worked and struggled forward. His hand held others, and for their sake he hid his shame, his fear, his hopelessness and his despair. He uttered words of surety and faith in life, and light and God, in love and understanding....... His tunnel disappeared. He noticed not its loss. Upon the playground of the world he stood with many fellow-players, wide to the light of day. In the far distance stood a mountain blue, and from its summit issued forth a voice which said: 'Come forward to the mountain top and on its summit learn the invocation of a Saviour.' To this great task the Follower, now a leader, bent his energies. He still pursues this way......." </p><p> ~.~ </p><p> I Conjour </p><p> "Above the head of the Magician, and just behind his back, and yet within the room of ordered beauty, a magnet vast began to oscillate....... It caused the revolution of the man, within the arch, which tottered to a future fall. The magnet turned him round until he faced the scene and room, unseen before....... Then through the centre of his heart the magnet poured its force attractive. The magnet poured its force repulsive. It reduced the chaos until its forms no longer could be seen. Some aspects of a beauty, unrevealed before, emerged. And from the room a light shone forth and, by its powers and life, forced the Magician to move forward into light, and leave the arch of peril." </p><p> ~ ~</p><p>Extract from 'Seven Stanzas' by Djwhal Khul</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="31"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="32">Full Moon</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
